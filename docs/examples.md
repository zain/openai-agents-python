# Examples

Check out a variety of sample implementations of the SDK in the examples section of the [repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples). The examples are organized into several categories that demonstrate different patterns and capabilities.


## Categories

- **agent_patterns**
  Examples in this category illustrate common agent design patterns, such as:
  - Deterministic workflows
  - Agents as tools
  - Parallel agent execution

- **basic**
  These examples showcase foundational capabilities of the SDK, such as:
  - Dynamic system prompts
  - Streaming outputs
  - Lifecycle events

- **tool examples**
  Learn how to implement OAI hosted tools such as web search and file search,
   and integrate them into your agents.

- **model providers**
  Explore how to use non-OpenAI models with the SDK.

- **handoffs**
  See practical examples of agent handoffs.

- **customer_service & research_bot**
  Two more built-out examples that illustrate real-world applications:
  - **customer_service**: Example customer service system for an airline.
  - **research_bot**: Simple deep research clone.
